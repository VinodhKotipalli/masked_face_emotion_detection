<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal of this project is to determine the degree to which facial expressions are accurately detectible while wearing a face mask.
We will be comparing the accuracy of a machine learning model trained on a dataset of unmasked faces to the same model trained on masked faces to determine the degree of inaccuracy introduced by masking of faces. The hope is to draw conclusions about the amount of nonverbal communication about our emotions is conveyed in the lower portion of the face and, thus, obscured by the face masks.
